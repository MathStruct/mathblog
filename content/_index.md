## About This Site

We’re a loose collective of mostly math and CS students at TU Chemnitz exploring the idea of starting our own company. We meet monthly in the clubroom at Vetterstraße 70/72—partly to talk startup ideas, partly just to catch up on life and projects. If you’d like to join, reach out (Daniel).

Right now our interests circle around:

- Extending Obsidian with richer graph structures (multi-node/edge types).

- Representing whole codebases as layered directed graphs (types, calls, hierarchies) to move beyond namespaces/modules/repos.

- Building full GraphRAG pipelines.

- Category theory, FP, theorem provers.

- Julia & Rust (e.g. serializing Julia functions, “native” DBs with serialized objects/functions).

- Startup basics: feasibility, pitch decks, B2B, funding.

The name *Mathstruct* comes from our love of math and code: “math” + “struct,” the building block in most languages—defining our mission of mathematical software.
