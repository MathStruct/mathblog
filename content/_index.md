# Hello, World!

## About This Site

Currently we are a loose collective of mainly math and computer science students at TU Chemnitz that discusses beginning our own startup. we have our monthly meetup where we discuss various topics relating to that. (but also have a general meetup on how our life and general work/interests are going.) It is in Vetterstraße 70/72 Clubroom. If you want to join please contact me (Daniel).

For everyone outside more is to come and once we find time we will begin seriously implementing something.

Currently we are specifically interested in:

- Extending Obsidian to allow multiple kind/colors of nodes/edges (Not that this is a longterm solution but now it's markdown + JSON)
- Representing entire repositories in Code graphs with multiple underlying directed graphs (like type hierarchies, function calls). Basically we want to abolish things like namespaces, modules, repositories.
- Building Full GraphRAG pipelines
- Category theory, Functional Programming, Theorem Provers
- Julia and Rust
  - Serialization of Julia functions
  - "Native" Databases that contain serialized objects (and functions) from programming languages.
- Startup Topics, feasibility of our ideas, PitchDeck, B2B Marketing, Gründiungsfinanzierung.

The name Mathstruct comes from us thinking about maths and being very affine in this thining and since we are also good programmers we are using "struct" since that is the central object in most programming languages. Thus defining our mission of writing mathematical software.
