[{"content":" Hello, World! # About This Site # We’re a loose collective of mostly math and CS students at TU Chemnitz exploring the idea of starting our own company. We meet monthly in the clubroom at Vetterstraße 70/72—partly to talk startup ideas, partly just to catch up on life and projects. If you’d like to join, reach out (Daniel).\nRight now our interests circle around:\nExtending Obsidian with richer graph structures (multi-node/edge types).\nRepresenting whole codebases as layered directed graphs (types, calls, hierarchies) to move beyond namespaces/modules/repos.\nBuilding full GraphRAG pipelines.\nCategory theory, FP, theorem provers.\nJulia \u0026amp; Rust (e.g. serializing Julia functions, “native” DBs with serialized objects/functions).\nStartup basics: feasibility, pitch decks, B2B, funding.\nThe name Mathstruct comes from our love of math and code: “math” + “struct,” the building block in most languages—defining our mission of mathematical software.\nFeatured Content # Blog: Check out my latest articles. Projects: See what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on. Contact: Get in touch with me.
